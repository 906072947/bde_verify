BDE Verify - A Static Checker for C++

Bde_verify is a static analysis tool that verifies that source code adheres
to the BDE coding standards.

The online documentation for bde_verify can be found here:
    <https://github.com/bloomberg/bde-tools/wiki/bde_verify>

Currently there is no binary distribution for bde_verify.  Bde_verify can be
built directly from source as described below.

Build Instructions
==================

Supported Platforms:
   o Linux x86
   o SunOS sparc

Prerequesites: 
   o llvm/clang 3.4.1 (see below for instructions)
   o gnu make
   o aspell 0.60.6.1

Currently, bde_verify is built with llvm/clang 3.4.1.  Source and binaries are
available for download at <http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#3.4.1>.
(But I have not tried using the pre-built binaries.)  To build from source,
download only LLVM and Clang sources and Clang extra tools:
    <http://llvm.org/releases/3.4.1/llvm-3.4.1.src.tar.gz>
    <http://llvm.org/releases/3.4.1/cfe-3.4.1.src.tar.gz>
    <http://llvm.org/releases/3.4/clang-tools-extra-3.4.src.tar.gz>

Follow build instructions here: <http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html>
until you are asked to run "../llvm/configure".  A configuration for
clang sufficient to build bde_verify on Linux can be specifed with the
following arguments to configure:

    --enable-optimized
    --enable-cxx11
    --prefix=<path to where you want clang installed>
    --with-gcc-toolchain=<$GCCDIR>
    LDFLAGS=-Wl,-z,muldefs -Wl,-rpath,$GCCDIR/lib64
    CXXFLAGS=-Wno-unused-local-typedefs
    CC=$GCCDIR/bin/gcc
    CXX=$GCCDIR/bin/g++
    CPP=$GCCDIR/bin/cpp

For bde_verify itself, there is no autoconf support to create a Makefile.
Set up the following variables in the Makefiles in the top-level and in the
csabase directories to hand-configure.

    COMPILER  = gcc or clang
    VERSION   = compiler version, e.g., 4.8.1
    CCDIR     = path to compiler installation directory
    LLVM      = path to LLVM installation
    ASPELL    = path to aspell installation

Once you have Clang installed and bde_verify Makefiles set up, build bde_verify
as follows.

    make -j            # build the code, then
    make -k check      # run test cases and report differences, or
    make -k run        # run test cases and show output
