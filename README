Cool Check - A Static Checker for C++

There is no autoconf support to create a Makefile, yet. The
location of the clang root directory and the version of clang need
to be set up manually in the Makefile.

    LLVM      = <path-to-llvm-root-directory>
    CLANGVERS = <clang-version>

Currently, the clang versions 2.9, 3.1, and SVN (for a recent head
of the development tree) are supported.

To build the source, use gmake:

    gmake               # build the code
    gmake check         # run test cases exercising the checks

Some of the output is filtered to make it more readable. For example,
the compiler invokation isn't shown. Similarily, the cheks only report
if they were successful rather than more details where they went wrong.
To get more detail, set the make variable VERBOSE to be empty, for
example:

    gmake check VERBOSE=
