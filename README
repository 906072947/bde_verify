BDE Verify - A Static Checker for C++

There is no autoconf support to create a Makefile.  Set up variables in the
Makefiles in the top-level and in the csabase directories to configure.

    COMPILER  = gcc, and should also work with clang
    VERSION   = compiler version, e.g., 4.8.1
    CCDIR     = path to compiler installation directory
    LLVM      = path to LLVM installation

Currently, bde_verify is built with llvm/clang 3.4.1.  You may choose to build
a clang installation from sources.  To do so, download from here,
<http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#3.4.1>, choosing only LLVM and Clang
sources, and Clang extra tools:
    <http://llvm.org/releases/3.4.1/llvm-3.4.1.src.tar.gz>
    <http://llvm.org/releases/3.4.1/cfe-3.4.1.src.tar.gz>
    <http://llvm.org/releases/3.4/clang-tools-extra-3.4.src.tar.gz>

Follow these build instructions: <http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html>.

A configuration for clang sufficient to build bde_verify on Linux is
    --enable-optimized
    --enable-cxx11
    --prefix=<path to where you want clang installed>
    --with-gcc-toolchain=<$GCCDIR>
    LDFLAGS=-Wl,-z,muldefs -Wl,-rpath,$GCCDIR/lib64
    CXXFLAGS=-Wno-unused-local-typedefs
    CC=$GCCDIR/bin/gcc
    CXX=$GCCDIR/bin/g++
    CPP=$GCCDIR/bin/cpp

Once you have Clang installed and bde_verify Makefiles set up, build bde_verify
as follows.

    make               # build the code, then
    make check         # run test cases and report differences, or
    make run           # run test cases and show output
