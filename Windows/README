To build BDE Verify for windows, you must have cmake installed.  Source and
binaries can be found here: <http://www.cmake.org/download/>.

If you also wish to create an installer for BDE Verify, you must have NSIS
(Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) installed.  Source and binaries can be
found here: <http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download>.

You must have a development installation of LLVM/Clang (with all of the include
files and libraries needed for building the compiler itself).  Source and
binaries can be found here: <http://llvm.org/releases/download.html>.  Set the
LLVM environment variable to the directory in which it is installed; the build
of BDE Verify looks in $LLVM/include for headers and $LLVM/lib for libraries.

Create a build directory, cd there, and run
    cmake .../path/to/bde-verify/
This will produce a bde_verify.sln solution file.  Open it in Visual Studio
and build the ALL_BUILD project to produce the bde_verify executable, or build
the PACKAGE project to build the automatic installer as well.
